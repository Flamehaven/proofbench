1/ üîÆ Introducing ProofBench ‚Äì the next generation of mathematical proof verification

Combines the precision of symbolic math with the intelligence of modern AI

Traditional proof checkers are either too rigid or too shallow. We solve this with hybrid reasoning.

[Demo GIF]

2/ How it works:
‚Ä¢ 70% Symbolic (SymPy/Pyodide in-browser)
‚Ä¢ 30% Semantic (Multi-LLM consensus)
‚Ä¢ = 100% Confidence with Logic Integrity Index (LII)

No backend dependencies, runs entirely in your browser! üöÄ

3/ Key features:
‚úì Domain-aware verification (Algebra, Topology, Logic)
‚úì Circular reasoning detection
‚úì Real-time feedback generation
‚úì Visual dependency graphs
‚úì 95% confidence intervals

[Screenshots]

4/ Built with modern tech:
‚Ä¢ TypeScript + React
‚Ä¢ Pyodide (Python in WebAssembly)
‚Ä¢ Docker + GitHub Actions
‚Ä¢ 100% test coverage
‚Ä¢ Production-ready

Open source (MIT) ‚Üí [link]

5/ We're just getting started. Roadmap:
v3.8: Real LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
v4.0: Backend API, user auth, collaborative editing

‚≠ê Star on GitHub if you find this interesting!
üë• Contributors welcome!
